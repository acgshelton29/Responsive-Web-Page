# Responsive-Web-Page
Practice at CSS and responsive web design.

The objective of this project is to recreate the Conquer bootsrap template (https://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates/page196/conquer) with normal CSS.
This will give me some practice with CSS positioning as well as some practice with responsive web design.
After finishing the project I am also considering adding some functionality to the contact form as well as maybe making it mobile friendly.
